                                A very warm welcome to all the stakeholders, including students, who aspire to be a part of Cluster University Srinagar.
                            </p>
                            <p>The establishment of Cluster University in 2016 was an innovative and a strategic intervention in the higher education sector of J&K. The change was driven by the need to decongest the Universities since the State Universities were overburdened with hundreds of affiliated colleges. In this short span of time, Cluster University Srinagar has carved a distinct identity by emerging as an important institution of higher learning. </p>
                            
                            <p>Cluster University Srinagar was created by pooling the resources of five existing colleges- Amar Singh College, SP College, Govt. College for Women, M. A. Road, Abdul Ahad Azad Memorial Degree College and Institute of Advanced Studies in Education (IASE). These five constituent colleges have adequate infrastructural facilities and they are all evolving in the form of advanced schools of learning. </p>
                            <p>Ever since I assumed the charge of Cluster University Srinagar as Vice Chancellor, I have been working to fulfill the vision and mission statement of the institution. </p>
                            <p>To act as a change agent, I believe we need to have a special focus on skill development and creation of skilled workforce by undertaking industry oriented teaching, training and research, extension programmes and providing employable skills with a view to contribute to the development of the society. Recently we floated several new skill courses to meet these objectives. </p>
                            <p>I firmly believe in establishing linkage with industry for promotion of science, technology, entrepreneurial skills, innovations, etc. and to adopt innovative methods to achieve the status of a self-reliant Institution. Modern tools of e-learning have become integral part of the educational system at Cluster University.  Innovative skill courses are being introduced with curriculum being designed as per the relevant needs of the industry. </p>
                            <p>We have also made provisions for integrated courses in humanities, social science, science and technology in the educational programmes. Subsequently, we launched several 5-year Integrated programmes. The importance of the Integrated programmes is that a student shall be able to choose his specialized discipline at an early stage and can remain focused in that subject. Most of the 5-year programmes have the exit option after completion of 3-years with B. A (B. Sc) honors degrees. After successfully completing 5-years, candidates shall be awarded Masters degrees. The advantage of the 5-year Integrated programme is that a candidate after successfully completing 3-years is assured of admission in the PG part of the programme. </p>
                            <p>
                                The aim of introducing different disciplines is to improve the employability of our students keeping in consideration the demands of the highly competitive job market.
                                Given the importance of co-curricular activities, we have constituted various centralized committees including the cultural committee and the sports committee to ensure all-round development of students.
                            </p>
                            <p>I believe in team-work. To ensure that it can fulfill its potential, the university needs its family members to work with sincerity and dedication. With this thing in mind, I held wide-ranging deliberations with staff members of all the constituent and affiliated colleges. The aim was to get their feedback and also to motivate them to work for the upliftment of the university. </p>
                            <p>Cluster University Srinagar is committed to implement the National Education Policy-2020 in letter and spirit to lay the foundation of a robust system which caters to the changing demands of the world. As Vice Chancellor, I will continue to pursue the policies and decisions which are in the best interest of students in particular and the society at large. </p>

                                <p>Prof. Sheikh Javid Ahmed studied at Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay and obtained his Ph.D degree in theoretical physics in 1987. After several years of postdoctoral studies at some of the leading laboratories of the world that include Daresbury Laboratory, England and Oak Ridge National Laboratory, USA, he joined the faculty of Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Bombay in 1994. In 2003, he was appointed as Professor of Physics at University of Kashmir. Prof. Javid has published more than 150 research articles in prestigious international journals and some of his publications are among top cited papers in nuclear physics.

He is on the advisory board of several international and national scientific organizations.</p>
                                <p>Professor Javid was recently elected Fellow of one of the most prestigious society of the world, the American Physical Society (APS). Prof. Javid is the first person to be bestowed with such an honor from the State of Jammu and Kashmir and one of the few selected from India. APS is world’s one of the largest organization of scientists with more than 50,000 members. The APS citation to Prof. Javid reads : “For the pioneering contribution to the study of nuclei beyond the valley of stability and for developing symmetry projected mean field equations”. The cited work was done when Prof. Javid was working as a scientist at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, USA and Technical University Munich, Germany. This work has given a new direction to nuclear physics research and several thousand papers have been written based on this original work.</p>
